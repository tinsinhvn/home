    abstract = {Droplet-based microfluidic devices have become widely used to perform single-cell {term}`RNA` sequencing (scRNA-seq). However, ambient {term}`RNA` present in the cell suspension can be aberrantly counted along with a cellâ€™s native mRNA and result in cross-contamination of transcripts between different cell populations. DecontX is a novel Bayesian method to estimate and remove contamination in individual cells. DecontX accurately predicts contamination levels in a mouse-human mixture dataset and removes aberrant expression of marker genes in PBMC datasets. We also compare the contamination levels between four different scRNA-seq protocols. Overall, DecontX can be incorporated into scRNA-seq workflows to improve downstream analyses.},
